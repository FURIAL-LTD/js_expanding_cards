# JavaScript Expanding Cards

This is a simple JS project where I created five containers, each with a picture from my unsplash portfolio. Clickling on one of the containers or "cards", highlights it as active and reveals it's picture.

### Technologies used:
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

### Bugs
Media query is not hidding the containers.
